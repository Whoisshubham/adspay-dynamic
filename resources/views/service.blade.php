                    </div>
                    <p>Programmatic buying or real-time bidding (RTB) is a method of selling and buying online display advertising in real time. The method is based on purchasing one ad impression at a time. The traditional media buying process involves a lot of manual work, typically with multiple requests for proposals (RFP), human negotiation and manual insertion of orders (iOS), which makes it slow and inefficient. As opposed to traditional inventory buying, programmatic buying acts just like stock exchanges and uses computer algorithms (ie programmatic) to automatically buy and sell advertisements in real time. For advertisers, programmatic buying offers the possibility to buy only the impressions they need at the price they are willing to use the DSP system's proprietary optimization algorithms and various 3rd party to fuel their algorithms The providers use data.</p>

                    <p>Performance marketing is a broad term for online marketing and advertising programs, where advertisers only pay when a specific action occurs. These actions can include a generated lead, a sale, a click, and more. While major corporations can spend millions of dollars on branding, most businesses need to pay attention to the bottom line to remain profitable. Performance puts marketing power back into the advertiser's hands.</p>
